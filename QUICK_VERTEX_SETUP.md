# Quick Vertex AI Setup Guide

## What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Your Google Cloud Project ID (get this from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id-here

# Region (usually us-central1)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1

# Path to your service account key file
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/orionx6/Desktop/OrionChat/packages/llm-adapters/src/providers/.google/service-account-key.json
```

### 2. Rename Your Service Account Key

Make sure your downloaded JSON key file is named:
```
/Users/orionx6/Desktop/OrionChat/packages/llm-adapters/src/providers/.google/service-account-key.json
```

### 3. Test the Setup

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Select a Vertex AI model**: Look for models with "(Vertex AI)" in the name
3. **Enable web search**: Click the Search button
4. **Ask a question**: Try "What are the latest AI developments?"
